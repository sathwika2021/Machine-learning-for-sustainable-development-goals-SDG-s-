Title: Early Detection Of Heart Disease

Description: Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality globally. Early detection and accurate
diagnosis are crucial for improving patient outcomes. Here we need to Develop a machine learning model that
can predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients based on their clinical and
demographic information using the dataset.

Insight Deliverable: A predictive model that accurately classifies patients into those with heart
disease and those without it.

In this project, I used Perceptron, KNN, AdaBoost, CatBoost models to detect the heart disease and concluded the best predictive model among them based on their performance metrics.Below are the insights of the project.

Insights:

Perceptron:

• Achieves the highest accuracy among the models.

• High precision indicates a good ability to correctly identify positive cases.

• Balanced recall suggests a decent ability to capture positive cases.

KNN:

• Moderate accuracy compared to other models.

• Precision and recall are relatively balanced.

AdaBoost:

• Demonstrates a solid balance between precision and recall.

• Competitive accuracy compared to other models.

CatBoost:

• Lowest accuracy among the models.

• High recall indicates the ability to capture all positive cases.

• Low precision suggests a higher rate of false positives.

Conclusion:

Perceptron appears to be the best-performing model, achieving the highest accuracy and a good
balance between precision and recall.Hence perceptron model is the one that accurately 
classifies patients into those with heart disease and those without it among other models which 
are implemented above.
